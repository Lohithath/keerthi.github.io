    <h2><b>There are 7 types of handloom weaving</b></h2>
</head>
<body>
    <p><b><mark>Frame looms</mark></b></p>
    <p>The lap loom, also known as a frame loom, is the most common hand weaving loom among beginners. Mainly because weaving on a frame loom is easy to learn, and they are very cheap.

        They are normally made out of wood and have a rectangular shape. It is not too heavy or too big, so you can hold it in your lap while weaving on it, hence its name.</p>
    <p><ul><li>Cheap</li></ul></p>
    <p><ul><li>Easier to learn</li></ul></p>
    <p><ul><li>Small and light weight</li></ul></p>
    <P><b><mark>Tapestry loom</mark></b></P>
    <P>On a frame loom the maximum size of your weave is constraint by the size of the frame itself.

        The tapestry loom is basically a frame loom but much larger. As a result, it’s too big to be used as a lap loom and normally it comes with a stand to keep it upright.
        
        Considering its large size and the fact that you will be weaving everything by hand, finishing a single weave will take a considerable amount of time.</P>
    <p><ul><li>Similar to a frame loom</li></ul></p>
    <p><ul><li>Often used with a stand</li></ul></p>
    <p><ul><li>Good for big projects</li></ul></p>
    <p><b><mark>Rigid heddle loom</mark></b></p>
    <P>The rigid heddle loom is also a good loom for beginners and many people that outgrow their lap loom will eventually upgrade to a rigid heddle loom.

        Compared to a lap looms, a rigid heddle loom might look a bit more complicated. But they are a joy to work with once you learn some pick-up stick and hand manipulation techniques.
        
        The main benefit of this type of loom over a lap loom is the option to use a heddle, which allows you to automatically shed the loom and lets you weave much faster.
        
        Moreover, rigid heddle looms are pretty small so you can easily store it or travel with it.</P>
    <P><ul><li>Good for both beginners and advanced weavers</li></ul></P>
    <P><ul><li>Not as expensive as other advanced looms</li></ul></P>
    <P><ul><li>Portable</li></ul></P>
    <p><b><mark>Inkle loom</mark></b></p>
    <P>
        An inkle loom looks very different from any of the looms mentioned above. But despite its strange looks, the weaving process on an inkle loom is very similar to other looms.
        
        However, inkle looms can only make very narrow projects such as bands and straps that can be used as a belt, necklace, for bags, etc.
        
        That’s why I normally wouldn’t recommend them to beginners. But if you are interested, you can read our article on inkle loom weaving.</P>
    <P><ul><li>Good addition to a frame or rigid heddle loom</li></ul></P>
    <p><ul><li>Works similar to other looms</li></ul></p>
    <p><ul><li>Only for narrow projects</li></ul></p>
    <P><b><mark>Floor loom</mark></b></P>
    <P>The floor loom is the biggest home weaving loom you can find. They take about the same amount of space as a piano and are quite heavy. With a floor loom you will be able to make big weaves for home linens or rugs for example.

        Depending on how they operate, the floor loom can be further divided into jack, counterbalance and countermarch types. Regardless, all three of them are used for producing complex and large projects.
        
        Considering their high cost, size, and difficulty to work with, these types of looms are geared towards the experienced weaver.</P>
    <P><ul><li>Difficult to learn</li></ul></P>
    <p><ul><li>Very heavy and big</li></ul></p>
    <p><ul><li>Good for making big weaves</li></ul></p>
    <P><b><mark>Table loom</mark></b></P>
    <P>A table loom is a smaller, less expensive and more portable version of the floor loom that can fit on top of a table or desk.

        Although they are smaller than floor looms, they are almost just as difficult to operate since they normally have between 4 and 8 shafts.
        
        They are great stepping stone for people that want to transition from a rigid heddle loom to a floor loom.
        
        But make sure there is someone that can teach you or a weaving class available in your area. Because teaching yourself how to weave on a table loom can be very difficult.</P>
    <P><ul><li>Pretty big and heavy</li></ul></P>
    <p><ul><li>Expensive</li></ul></p>
    <p><ul><li>Difficult to learn</li></ul></p>
    <P><b><mark>Bead loom</mark></b></P>
    <P>Bead looms are used to make jewelry and accessories like necklaces, bracelets, belts, headbands, etc. They can also be used to make smaller weaves to decorate a bigger pieces.

        Note that bead weaving is very different from regular weaving. You need to use a completely different technique to incorporate the beads into your weave. As a result you will see little crossover between these two communities.
        
        Unless you are really into beads, I won’t recommend a bead loom to beginning weavers. I merely included them for completeness.</P>
    <P><ul><li>Used to make jewelry and accessories</li></ul></P>
    <P><ul><li>Requires different weaving technique</li></ul></P>
    <P><ul><li>Skills don’t transfer to other loom types</li></ul></P>
